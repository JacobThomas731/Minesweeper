# Minesweeper game using Python
A simple minesweeper game made with Python using the pygame module.

## Introduction
*Minesweeper* is classic, single player puzzle game that orginated in the 1960s.
It is a popular casual game and since then has been featured in many computing systems. More about *minesweeper* and how to play it can be found here - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)

## Aim of the project
  - To create a *pygame* based *minesweeper* game
  - To learn and understand the workings of *pygame* by creating a simple classic game.

## Technologies use
For this project *pygame* module was used. Since the game is simple and the code short, procedure oriented programming was used instead of object oriented programming.

## Launching
 The repository has both the code as well as an *exe* file (which will run in a *windows* platform). To run the code, *python* and *pygame* must be installed in the system and the images must in the adjacent folder. For *exe*, the images too must be in the adjacent folder.

## Development
As stated, this game was created in *python* using the *pygame* module. Procedural oriented programming was followed. While I havent focused heavily on efficiency, I did strive to reduce the time space complexity wherever possible.

## Developer comments
This is my first 'serious' project that I've undertaken. At the writing of this document I'm pursuing my Bachelor's in Technology (CS) as a second year student. 

This project is a fairly basic one. It is not feature complete and its not heavily optimised. Many things can be added, which I might in the future. But since this project is among the firsts for me, it goes well with me, as I'm climbing up in the learning scale.

As far as I know there are no bugs, but if ever you find one, feel free to contact me -
